	<td>Create a dataset of 50-60 random x, y coordinate points where x is a timestamp and y is the position in a 1D plane. The dataset should not have exact random points, but instead, it should follow a pattern with some error to prevent overfitting. Linear regression should be used to predict the next 2-3 points in the path. Finally, the whole path with time should be plotted using Matplotlib.</td>
